I love working at the intersection of automation and analytics, creating tools that not only streamline processes but also enhance decision-making with meaningful insights. Most recently, I interned as a Software Engineer at Newegg, where I designed and deployed an AI-powered product review summarizer, integrating web scraping and MySQL to uncover data-driven strategies for boosting sales. Before that, I researched online privacy and cybersecurity at Macalester College, exploring how digital communities navigate security challenges. Whether it's optimizing data workflows, enhancing security, or building AI-driven applications, Iâ€™m always looking for ways to make technology more efficient and impactful.",
